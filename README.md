# 🛒 Blinkit Data Analysis Project
A data analytics project using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Blinkit is an online grocery platform. The dataset contains details about items, their categories, outlet sales, and visibility.  
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Understand what factors affect item sales.  
- Find which outlet types perform the best.  
- Identify product demand trends.  
- Provide recommendations for improving sales.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the **Blinkit dataset** (an online grocery delivery service) using **Python**.  
The analysis is performed with the help of:
- **Pandas** 
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
The goal is to extract insights into **sales performance, outlet types, item visibility, and customer preferences**, and to answer key business questions that can help optimize operations.

## 🔑 Key KPIs
- Total Sales
- Average Sales
- Number Of Items
- Average Rating

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
1.Total sales by fat content
2.Total Sales by Item Type
3.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
4.Total Sales by Outlet Establishment
5.Sales by Outlet Size
6.Sales by Outlet Location Type

Visualizations were built using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 💡 Insights & Conclusion
- **Supermarket Type 3 outlets** perform the best in terms of sales.  
- Higher `Item Sales` tends to correlate with higher sales, showing consumer preference for premium products.  
- Smaller outlets with limited visibility face challenges in achieving higher sales.  
- Certain product categories (like fruits & vegetables, snack foods) dominate demand.
